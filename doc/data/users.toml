# [unique_key] # This can be any unique TOML key string (cannot contain spaces or periods)
#              # It would suffice to set this to your GitHub/Gitlab/etc. username in most cases.
#   author = "Foo Bar" (*mandatory*)
#   source = "Git repo of your site; needs to have the Org source" (*mandatory*)
#   site = "https://your.site/" (*mandatory*)
#
#   org_dir = "Dir in the repo containing Org source" (default to "" if not set i.e. Org source file is directly in your repo root)
#   branch = "git branch containing Org source" (defaults to "main" if not set)
#
# Misc other keys:
#
#   org_src_desc = "Org file" (set this if the link in 'source' key points to just an Org file.
#
# Extra keys that might apply if not hosting your repo on GitHub or Gitlab:
#
#   hosting = "gitea"
#     - Set hosting to "gitea" only if your repo is hosted on a Gitea instance, whether
#       or not you have the Swagger API enabled.
#   api = "gitea" or "micro.json" (shouldn't be set if source is in a GitHub or Gitlab repo)
#     - Set api to "gitea" if you host your repo on a Gitea instance
#       *and* you have the Gitea Swagger v1 API enabled.
#     - Set api to "micro.json" if:
#       - your repo is neither on GitHub or Gitlab, and
#       - if your repo is on Gitea, but you don't have its API enabled, and
#       - you have added this theme component: https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-micro-json, and
#       - added "Micro" custom output format to your "home" page Kind
#         (see instructions in that theme's README.org).
